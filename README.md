# Easter Egg Game
This game is all about easter eggs.  Just click around and try to find all of the secrets!  However, beware of enemies lurking in the shadows...

Note: This game is a Work In Progress.  There are currently 20ish Easter Eggs, but we are adding more, so stay tuned!

Note 2: School has resumed, and we will be updating this game again.  This README will not be very well maintained though.

Note 3: School is in progress, and we will not be updating this game for a while because of work :P We will probably start again sometime next year

Release Date:

Official release date will be April 12, 2020 (Easter 2020) possibly easter of 2021 considering our progress ...

In my opinion, we won't even finish by 2022 so uh :P

The original release date was for Easter 2019 but whatever.

Our current progress has gone from -_- to :D - 6/4/2019

Visionist is now celebrating 15 years of incompetence, laziness, and memes. :P 

Our progress has been interesting over the past few months, due to Fluffcake's inability to not procrastinate. But that's fine :P

We will try to update stuff as soon as possible lol

or just give up XD

We will start when we will end
